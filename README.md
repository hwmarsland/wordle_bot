# Wordle Bot

DESCRIPTION
- This program is a solution tool for the New York Times' Wordle puzzle.

USAGE
- This program is run in the command line with the prompt "python wordle_bot.py"
- When started, the program will give the user a word to enter into the Wordle game then request the pattern of green, yellow, and black letters generated by entering the specific word.

PROGRAM STEPS
- Begins by reading and formatting data from the possible_words.txt and optimal_second_words.xlsx files to be used later.
- Suggests the word SLATE to the user to input
- Based on the pattern returned by the user, slims down the potential words list and chooses the optimal second word and suggests it to the user
- Then until the correct word is selected, based on the previous pattern returned by the user the program slims down the potential words list, selects the first word from that list and suggests it to the user.

TESTING
- On 100 tests, average words for a correct guess was 3.44
  - 95% win rate (1 program error, 4 losses due to not guessing the word within 6 guesses)
  - 58 times won on 3rd guess
  - 32 times won on 4th guess
  - 5 times won on 5th guess
- Testing history can be seen in the wordle_bot_successes.xlsx file
